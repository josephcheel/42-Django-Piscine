	<p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.</p> 
	<p>It was created in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison while they were working at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper. </p>
	<p>The framework was born out of the need to build web applications quickly and efficiently, with a focus on reusability and "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principles.</p>
